# I have a text-based form editor with import and export functionalities for created forms.

For a deeper understanding of the core functionality, you also can have a look at the level.

# level 1
It must be possible to type /{command} into the editor field, while the command is one of the given functions:
- /headline: inserts and renders a html <h1> headline into the editor window.
- /textinput: inserts and renders a html <input> field into the editors window
- /option: inserts and renders a html <option> field with 3 possible options.

# level 2
I have added functionality to import and export the created form in JSON format.

# level 3
I have made the individual form components drag and drop-able, so they can be reordered
